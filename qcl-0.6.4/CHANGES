Changes in 0.6.1:
 * Fixed -x option bug
 * new option --qcluserdir, --include-path renamed to --qcldir
 * new enviroment variable QCLUSERDIR

Changes in 0.6.0:
 * Code cleanups for ISO C++ compliance
 * Dropped static binary support

Changes in 0.5.1:
 * Double declaration as "qufunct operator" for non-boolean implementations
   of basis permutations
 * Recursive operator definitions
 * New auto-dump format which displays registers 
 * Sample implementation of Deutsch's algorithm

Changes in 0.5.0:

 * Conditional Operators and quantum conditions (experimental)
 * Vectors, matrices and tensors (see linalg.qcl)
 * New elementary operators (see default.qcl)
 * Plotting of states and spectrums via the new "plot" command
 * New and revised sample programs
 * break-statement for loops
 * Bitwise not, and, or, xor as built-in functions
 * Built in function bit(n,i) (i-th bit of binary expansion of n)
 * Improved TeXmacs support 
 * Support for keyboard interrupts (SIGINT, SIGTSTP)
 * Optimizations in the simulation layer (more than 300% speedup in some
   cases)
 * Removal of legacy code for old complex- and string-classes 
 * Improved support for non-Intel plattforms
 * Rewrite of Error handling to use C++ exceptions
 * Major code-cleanups
 * Minor bug fixes

Changes in 0.4.3:

 * Color XTerm and TeXmacs support (by Andrey G. Grozin).
 * Bug with random() on non-GNU systems fixed (thanks to Joel Hegg).
 * Internal changes.

Changes in 0.4.2:

 * Compile glitch fixed with RedHat 7.2.
 * Nicer output of quantum states.

Changes in 0.4.1:

 * ANSI C++ complience (except for local array variables).
 * Fixed unitarity testing for matrix operators.
 * Minor bugfixes.

Changes in 0.4.0:

 * As the available documentation already exceeds the size of the
   source code by an order of magnitude, the manual is no longer part
   of the main distribution. If you are new to QCL, you probably want
   do check out the Documentation section below.
 * A sample inplementation of Grover's Database Search algorithm is
   contained in the lib directory.
 * The QCL searchpath now also looks for qcl-files in ./lib.
 * Besides the dynamically linked program, the binary package now
   also contains a static binary qcl-static.
 * minor bugfixes.
